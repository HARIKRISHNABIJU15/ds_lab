# ds_lab
Contains solutions for all DS Lab Programs.
This repository contains all you need for DS Lab of KTU Semester 3
The program description are given below and you can open the corresponding program from the repository.

1.Write a function rotate(int a[],int n,char d,int cr) to rotate given array elements.The function will take the array, number of elements in the array, direction of rotation(l-left r-right) and count of rotation( how many times to rotate)
2.Find the mean, median and mode of list of elements. Use array to implement the same.(assume Unimode )
3.Find the frequency of occurrence of each character in the string ( histogram)
4.Consider two sets S1={1,2,3,4}, and S2={3,4,5}. Find the intersection of S1 and S2={3,4}.Implement the set operation intersection using arrays.
5.An nx4 array stores 4 bit binary numbers. Read the matrix and print the hexadecimal equivalent of the same.
