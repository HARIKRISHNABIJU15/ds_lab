<h3>DS LAB</h3>
<p>Contains solutions for all DS Lab Programs.
This repository contains all you need for DS Lab of KTU Semester 3
The program description are given below and you can open the corresponding program from the repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>1.Write a function rotate(int a[],int n,char d,int cr) to rotate given array elements.The function will take the array, number of elements in the array, direction of rotation(l-left r-right) and count of rotation( how many times to rotate)</li>
<li>2.Find the mean, median and mode of list of elements. Use array to implement the same.(assume Unimode )</li>
<li>3.Find the frequency of occurrence of each character in the string ( histogram)</li>
<li>4.Consider two sets S1={1,2,3,4}, and S2={3,4,5}. Find the intersection of S1 and S2={3,4}.Implement the set operation intersection using arrays.</li>
<li>5.An nx4 array stores 4 bit binary numbers. Read the matrix and print the hexadecimal equivalent of the same.</li>
<li>6.Write a program to read two polynomials and store them in an array.
Calculate the sum of the two polynomials and display the first
polynomial, second polynomial and the resultant polynomial.</li>
<li>7.Read and polynomial of degree n and store in an array. Evaluate this
polynomial for a given value of x.
Eg: 3x^2+2x+1
x=2
evaluation=12+4+1=17</li>
<li>8.Given a sparse matrix . Represent and store it using an efficient
method. Also find the sparsity (The sparsity of a matrix can be
quantified with a score, which is the number of zero values in the
matrix divided by the total number of elements in the matrix.)</li>
<li>9.Input the representation of two sparse matrices. Obtain the
representation of their sum.</li>
<li>10.Input the representation of a sparse matrix. Find the representation
of its transpose.</li>
<li>11.Check whether the given matrix is sparse symmetric using the
representation given.</li>
<li>12.Implement a stack using an array.</li>
<li>13.Implement multiple stacks(2 stacks) using an array. Consider memory
efficient implementation</li>
<li>14.Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time using an auxiliary stack
which keeps track of the minimum element.</li>
<li>15.implement a sorted push so that stack is always maintained in sorted order.</li>
<li>16.Convert a given decimal number into binary and hex using stack.</li>
<li>17.Check whether a string is palindrome using stack.</li>
<li>18.Check whether the parenthesis are balanced in an expression using stack.</li>
<li>19.Convert a given infix expression to postfix/prefix using stack.</li>
<li>20.Evaluate a postfix/prefix expression.</li>
